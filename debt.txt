- tests use temp files
- FileStorage and LogicalTest assert on private attirbutes
- serialization is coupled to the logical layer
- LogicalTest.test_set() and test_pop() use a very fragile approach
- data format / implementation of logical layer requires requires reading all
  keys to memory and/or exposing extra methods in FileStorage next_address()
- code repetition in tests.py: delete_files()
- structure of QueryProcessor.execute() makes it difficult to unit test
  the various pieces of functionality it needs.
- spec for QueryProcessor.execute() prevents it from throwing exceptions
  when errors occur.
- 2-file design makes it cumbersome for the client to document what files
  will be created given a database name
- no tests for client
