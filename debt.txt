- FileStorageTest and LogicalTest use temp files
- FileStorage and LogicalTest assert on private attirbutes
- serialization is coupled to the logical layer
- popping a non-existent key adds that key to the keys file
- LogicalTest.test_set() and test_pop() use a very fragile approach
- data format / implementation of logical layer requires requires reading all
  keys to memory and/or exposing extra methods in FileStorage next_address()
